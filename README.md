Software Test, Automation QA

Q: How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?\
A: I write unit tests using JUnit to validate core functionality and catch edge cases early. I also handle input validation and follow secure coding practices to prevent common vulnerabilities like invalid data or injection risks.\

Q: How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?\
A: I break down user requirements into actionable features, then translate those into code that meets both functional and usability goals. I keep the architecture modular so it's easier to adapt when user needs evolve.\
<br/>
Q: How do I approach designing software?\
A: I focus on clean, maintainable design by separating concerns and structuring the code into logical components. I usually start with a rough plan or pseudocode, then build out each part while making sure it integrates smoothly with the rest of the system.
